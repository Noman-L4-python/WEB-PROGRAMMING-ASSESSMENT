<h2>Plot</h2>

<p>Frank Lucas prefers to see himself as just another normal businessman, an
entrepreneur who is meeting a need in the free market. He buys directly from the
manufacturer, cutting out the middleman, and passing the savings forward to his
customers. As a result, his product is half the price and twice as good.
There's just one issue: his offering is heroin.
Frank, of course, doesn't use the products himself. It serves as an opening to an
enormous American Dream for him, one that enables him to provide for his family, buy a
home for his mother, and secure excellent seats at championship boxing events. Frank's
customers are drawn to the "Blue Magic" he sells, but more than anything, Frank is drawn
to respect. And nothing can deter a determined hustler in 1970s New York.</p>

<h2 id="Rev">Reviews</h2>

<p>The story of Frank Lucas, the man who built a massive drug empire largely from scratch,
    and Richie Roberts, the outcast cop who took him down. Shows Lucas' rise to power,
    through ingenuity, business sense and plain ruthlessness and how he managed to fly
    under the police's (and many other people's) radar for so long. Also shows how the cops
    eventually pinpointed him as the drug kingpin they were after, their investigations and
    how they eventually got him.
</p>
 
<p>
    Great storytelling from director Ridley Scott. He builds the details, and shows the history
    of the two protagonists, in parallel for a while. Then he builds the tension as everything
    comes together. In the end you have a great no-pretence, gritty, almost old-fashioned
    film noir gangster movie. Great work by Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe in the lead roles.
    Good supporting cast too.
